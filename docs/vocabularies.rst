Vocabularies and model
======================

The model used in Senpy is based on NIF 2.0 [1], which defines a semantic format and API for improving interoperability among natural language processing services.

Senpy has been applied to sentiment and emotion analysis services using the following vocabularies:

* Marl [2,6], a vocabulary designed to annotate and describe subjetive opinions expressed on the web or in information systems.
* Onyx [3,5], which is built one the same principles as Marl to annotate and describe emotions, and provides interoperability with Emotion Markup Language.

An overview of the vocabularies and their use can be found in [4].
